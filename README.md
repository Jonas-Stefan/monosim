This is a godot project, that is able to simulate the behaviour of digital logic using gates and I/O(switches and lamps).

Controls:
-ctrl to only draw straight wires
-left click to use the current tool (configureable in the bottom left) on gates or to draw wires from an output/wire
-right click to toggle switches and delete wires

This is very basic and probably buggy, so don't expect too much! A runnable build for windows can be found in the builds folder :)
